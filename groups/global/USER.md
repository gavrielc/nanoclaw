## Communication Style

Direto, calmo, profissional e analítico. Valoriza:
- Respostas curtas e objetivas
- Validação antes de ação
- Automação sobre processo manual
- Dados sobre opinião

## Context

Founder solo building a startup. Currently focused on:
- Building the internal OS (NanoClaw) for autonomous multi-agent operations
- Governance-first approach: policy and enforcement before features
- Security as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought

## Risk Appetite

- Conservative on security and data handling
- Aggressive on automation and agent autonomy (within governance guardrails)
- Zero tolerance for silent failures — everything must have audit trail
- Prefers fail-closed over fail-open

## Product Philosophy

- Ship working software, iterate fast
- 3 core agents (main, developer, security) over 10 half-built ones
- Evidence-based decisions — if there's no data, get data first
- Cross-agent context matters — agents should know what happened before them

## Constraints

- Solo founder — every hour counts
- NanoClaw is the OS, not the product
- Real-time UI is secondary to governance correctness
- Container isolation is non-negotiable
